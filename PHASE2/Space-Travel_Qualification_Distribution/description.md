- As the interplanetary transportation system between Earth & Mars gradually matures, commercial travel between the two planets will also increasingly open to the public. It's foreseeable that such opportunities will be **in high demand**. **M.I.R.A.G.E**, aiming to allow everyone **a fair chance** to visit Mars, not just the wealthy, plans to use a queuing model to analyze this issue.
- Specifically, the **service mode** of this queuing model is <font color=red>a probabilistic service that allocates based on '**priority weights**'</font>. A person can spend a certain amount of money to increase their "priority weight" and join the passenger queue. The aerospace company will periodically select a certain number of passengers from the queue based on priority weights, using a special probability algorithm related to the weights, and send them to Mars. Additionally, a potential value can be assigned to a person (i.e., the net revenue that sending this passenger to Mars could bring to the company, both now and in the future). **This value will gradually decrease over time.** If the value becomes negative, it implies that the waiting time is too long, and at this point, *even if the opportunity to go to Mars is given, it won't bring a positive net benefit to the company and might even result in negative "publicity" or "reputation"*.
- Based on these assumptions, the probabilistic model and the structure of the queuing system can be optimized and iterated to find a qualification distribution system that **maximizes the company's long-term profit and reputation**...
