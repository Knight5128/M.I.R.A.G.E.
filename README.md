# M.I.R.A.G.E.
- This is a grand Mars Construction Plan inspired by Operations Research. The optimal goal is to **establish a city cluster on Mars & be fully prepared for further exploration**.
- We've created a fictional enterprise **M.I.R.A.G.E.**(*Mars Innovation & Research Associated General Establishment*) as the entity of the whole project.
- The project is still in its early stages, but it will be updated continuously in the long term.
- *Complete Project* includes:
    - **envisionary optimization models** &
    - **code implementations** &
    - **integrated problem-solving software** &
    - other stuff
- **Everyone** is welcomed to *share your ideas* & *make necessary modifications* & *point out new research directions and insights* so that we can ***build the future together!***

# Development Concept & Timeline (Preliminary)
  - ### *Phase One* —— **Initial Construction**
    - This phase focuses on establishing the initial habitable settlement, encompassing the construction of essential infrastructure such as housing, life support systems, and energy facilities. During this period, *cost still needs to be considered* and the construction relies heavily on resources transported from Earth. The **core optimization challenge** is to <u>devise the most efficient strategy for spacecraft construction and launch to meet the demands for resource and manpower transportation while minimizing the total cost</u>.
  - ### *Phase Two* —— **Further Expansion**
    - This phase focus on expanding the initial habitable area into a larger city, which will eventually turn into a city cluster capable of accommodating around half a million people through constant collection of local resources and exploration of unexploited area. The central city will provide most of the energy sources for the surrounding cities. Earth-Mars transportation system will also be established. Launches from Earth are still needed, which shall be self-financed by motivated applicants attracted to the wonders of Martian life, so *cost won't be a problem during this period*. However, there are some other **Possible optimization problems** including <u>①optimization of metro operation; ②scheduling of elevator system inside each city; ③design a space-travel qualification distribution system that maximizes corporation's profit & reputation...</u>.
  - ### *Phase Three* —— **Continuous Progression**
    - The main goal of the final phase is to achieve self-sufficiency in energy supply within each city in the cluster, reducing reliance on the central city by introducing power plants. This involves assessing & selecting the suitable locations of power plants and the construction & maintenance of an energy distribution network. It should be noted that *'cost' needs to be reconsidered from now on*, because all future development on Mars will be financed by a common wealth system(miniCUminiCU system) of all Martian citizens. The **key optimization problem** is to ensure that <u>the energy needs of each city and energy supply station are met through mutual support, while also maintaining a certain surplus of energy to mitigate future risks, all the while minimizing the cost of operating the entire energy supply network per unit of time</u>.
